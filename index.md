Welcome to the page of the reading groups at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Freiburg!

We host several regular reading groups focusing on different aspects of machine learning, robotics, and computer vision:

- [DLHO](#dlho-reading-group-deep-learning--hyperparameter-optimization)
- [RL](#rl-reading-group-reinforcement-learning)
- [Diffusion](#diffusion-reading-group)
- [Mobility](#mobility-reading-group)
- [Manipulation](#manipulation-reading-group)

## DLHO Reading Group (Deep Learning & Hyperparameter Optimization)

**Time**: Wednesdays, 15:00-16:00

**Location**: [Building 052, Room 01-031 (LMB Seminar room/Kitchen)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UfCw3CzG5nJ2VJAD8)  

**Zoom**: [Join Zoom Meeting](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uni-freiburg.zoom.us/j/68382621585?pwd%3DeFdncFpZeWlxVnpBdVV4cHNpNTArdz09&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw3R-wRdPquFBVR2ZwNzdnFD) (Meeting ID: 683 8262 1585, Passcode: N10aUFYZq)
